The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT solution designed to automate and optimize irrigation processes. It integrates a soil moisture sensor with an ESP32 module to monitor soil moisture levels in real time. When moisture falls below a set threshold, the system initiates irrigation, ensuring plants receive adequate water.

Features
Automated Irrigation: Activates irrigation based on real-time soil moisture levels.
Remote Monitoring & Control: Users can manage irrigation schedules from anywhere via a web or mobile interface, thanks to cloud connectivity.
Data Visualization: The Blynk IoT platform provides real-time soil moisture data, alerts, and interactive controls for adjusting irrigation settings.
Sustainability: Enhances agricultural efficiency by optimizing water usage.
Components
Hardware: ESP32, soil moisture sensors, relay module, water pump, breadboard, jumper wires, batteries, and water tube.
Power Supply: Powered by the ESP32 and an additional battery for the water pump.
Benefits
Efficiency: Improves water-use efficiency and agricultural management.
User-Friendly: Provides a simple interface for monitoring and controlling irrigation.
Sustainability: Supports sustainable farming practices by minimizing water usage.
